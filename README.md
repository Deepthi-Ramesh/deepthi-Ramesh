# Hi, I'm Deepthi Ramesh 👋

I'm a driven **Full Stack Developer** specializing in the MERN stack (MySQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), with a proven track record in building scalable web applications.

Currently at **Accenture**, I optimize internal tools for efficiency and performance. Previously, I interned at **Talentstech** and was a **Smart India Hackathon 2022 Finalist**, leading a team to build a secure, role-based government welfare app.

I've tackled **350+ LeetCode problems**, built projects like a Java-based student management system, and keep up with the latest in web and cloud tech.
